A tool for symmetrization of magnetic tight-binding Hamiltonian generated by 
the wannier90.

The code is still a little bit clumsy. You have to run it twice. In the first
(second) step, it performs symmetrization using magnetic space group operations 
without (with) time reverse operation. 

The preparation of input is similar to that in the "wannhr_symm". The additional
input is "magmom.in". Please read it for the setting.

example_mag provides an example and job.sh for run the code. Please modify job.sh
and your PYTHONPATH accordingly.
